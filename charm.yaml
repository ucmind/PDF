    # Turn Your Idea into a Launch-Ready Project
    
    Meet your new technical co-founder team. The **SaaS Launchpad Crew** is an autonomous squad of AI agents designed to accelerate your project's zero-to-one phase.
    
    Whether you have a detailed PDF spec or just a rough idea in text, this crew will research, analyze, and build the foundation for you.
    
    ## The Crew
    * Strategic Analyst: Dissects your requirements, identifies risks, and performs deep market research.
    * Resource Hunter: Scours GitHub, ArXiv, and Kaggle to find existing tools, preventing you from reinventing the wheel.
    * Lead Architect: Designs a scalable system architecture and generates production-ready MVP boilerplate code.
    
    ## What You Get 
    1.  Deep-Dive Analysis: Market gaps, technical feasibility, and objective breakdowns.
    2.  Smart Resource List: Curated APIs, datasets, and open-source libraries relevant to your idea.
    3.  Codebase Starter Kit: A complete Python project structure with core components, API integrations, and tests pre-written.
    
    ## How to Use
    Simply upload a **Requirements PDF** OR paste your **Project Idea** directly in the text box. The crew handles the rest.
